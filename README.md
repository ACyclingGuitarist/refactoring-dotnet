- Programming to abstractions instead of implementations
- Replacing conditional logic with polymorphism
- Using factory methods

- Using `Task.FromResult` for non-asynchronous overiddes of `Task` methods
- Writing unit and integration tests
- Monitoring code quality using static code analysis
- Creating a continuous integration loop
